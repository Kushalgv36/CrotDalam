# CrotDalama
CROT DALAM is a Python CLI that performs OSINT on TikTok without any API keys. It drives a real Chromium browser (via Playwright) to search public TikTok pages by keyword, extracts video metadata, applies scam/phishing risk heuristics (EN/ID), and exports JSONL + CSV (optionally screenshots for evidence).
